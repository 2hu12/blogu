# BLOGU

Blogu is not that light but simple and fresh as a blog engine, which is
inspired by some existing static blog framework. [Demo][] and [My Blog][].


## Prerequisites

+ *nix os
+ node
+ gulp(global installed)

## Document

#### 1. Installation

```bash
$ mkdir myblog
$ git clone https://github.com/zhulongzheng/blogu.git myblog
```

#### 2. Configuration

Config your `config.json`
```bash
$ cd myblog
$ cp example/config.json config.json
```

| OPTIONS        | FOR                  |
| :------------- | :------------------- |
| name           | name tile of index   |
| slogan(option) | some words           |
| description    | as meta description  |
| theme          | corrent only default |
| email          | for contact          |
| link           | some other link      |
| git            | git page repo        |
| branch         | git repo branch      |
| domain(option) | blog domain          |

> Tip: You can use github and gitcafe pages service, so the branch option is
required, and if you use github page for project, `branch` should be `gh-pages`,
and for gitcafe, `gitcafe-pages`. Or if you want to consume the only user `io`
page, branch should be `master`.

then

```bash
$ make init
```
> Tip: The `make init` better use for only once. If you forget some
configuration, check out the [remedy][].

Also you can "decorate" it by switching `theme/default/avatar.png` and
`theme/default/favicon.ico`.


#### 3. Write A New Post

```bash
$ make post name="Whatever your new post title is"
```

#### 4. Generate

```bash
$ make gen
```
or shorter one

```bash
$ make g
```

#### 5. Local Server

```bash
$ make server
```
or shorter one

```bash
$ make s
```

#### 6. Deploy To Github

You should do this after generated by `make gen`.

```bash
$ make depoly
```
or shorter one

```bash
$ make d
```

#### 7. Development

```bash
$ make dev
```

#### 8. Some Remedy
Reconfig your config.json.

In case you forget to config git repo befor you run `make init`:
```bash
$ make addgit
```

In case you want to reconfig git repo:
```bash
$ make editgit
```

In case you want to reconfig git branch:
```bash
$ make editbr
```

In case you want to reconfig domain:
```bash
$ make adddomain
```
